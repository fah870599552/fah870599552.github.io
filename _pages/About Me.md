Hello! My name is Lanyue Tang. I grew up in Jiangsu Province and received a bachelor's degree from Southeast University(Nanjing, China). I am currently studying for a master's degree at Tongji University (Shanghai, China), and I belong to the  [TRAFFIC OPERATIONS & SIMULATION lab](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/) led by Professor Jian Sun.

My major is transportation engineering. My research interests include human-machine interaction, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle, and traffic simulation.

Outside of academics, I like to go camping and hiking with my family, friends and my dog, her name is Apple. I like to use my camera to record the beautiful natural scenery and the smiles of my family during the travels. Additionally, I enjoy running, hiking, swimming, and playing tennis (still practicing).
