Hi! My name is Lanyue Tang. I grew up in West Monroe, Louisiana, and I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Business Economics from Louisiana Tech University ('17). 

I am an Economics Ph.D. Candidate at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. My research interests are in applied microeconomics and specifically in health economics and information frictions. My work focuses on the role of information in health care in settings such as telehealth and telemedicine usage, price transparency regulation, and choice of insurance coverage.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my wife Hannah, who is a middle school Language Arts/STEAM teacher and fabrication lab facilitator, and my dog Olan, who is asleep on the couch. 

I enjoy shooting hoops, hiking, running, rock climbing, traveling, and trying new foods. I'm a big fan of NBA basketball and root for the Indiana Pacers.

A fun fact about me: prior to being a Ph.D. student, I spent time performing with a metalcore band called They Will Fall. While doing this, I also booked and promoted shows in the DIY music scene in north Louisiana. Doing this for several years shaped who I am as a person in a variety of ways, and so I really treasure the memories from this part of my life.
