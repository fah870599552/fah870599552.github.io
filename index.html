<p> <b>Parallel-Computing-Based Simulation Calibration Paper</b>: "Parallel-Computing-Based Calibration for Microscopic Traffic Simulation Model" </p>

<p> <small> <b>Abstract</b>: Microscopic traffic simulation is vital to assess the performances of various traffic operation and management schemes. Microscopic traffic simulation is usually not parameter-free, and it relies on independent parameters to predict traffic evolution. Thus, parameter calibration is indispensable to conveying trustworthy simulation results. Heuristic algorithms are widely used for parameter calibration. Its logic is for achieving iterative optimization through continuous trial-and-error simulations. This process is time-consuming and usually takes several hours, making the calibration unable to meet the requirements of speed and efficiency. In recent years, parallel computing technology has been gradually applied in the engineering realm, which makes rapid calibration possible. Following the three steps of parallel framework selection, algorithm bottleneck identification, and subtask load balancing, this paper designs and implements the parallelization of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) calibration algorithms. Finally, the proposed parallel framework is applied to simulation parameter calibration of a section of a 5 km long highway in Australia, and the effectiveness of parallel computing is evaluated from the two dimensions of reduction in calibration computational time and scalability. The results show that the proposed parallel calibration algorithm can shorten the 5 h calibration process to less than 1 h, reducing the calibration time by 80%. The parallel PSO calibration algorithm has better scalability, and its acceleration effect is better when more processors are used.  </small> </p>

<p> <b>Trajectory Prediction Paper</b>: "CPSOR-GCN: A trajectory prediction method considering emotion in pre-crash scenarios based on SOR theory" </p>

<p> <small> <b>Abstract</b>: Active safety systems on vehicles often face problems with false alarms. Such false alarms can reduce driver trust in active safety systems. The principle of most active safety systems is to calculate safety risks based on predictions of vehicle trajectories, assuming that the driver is in a normal state. However, when the driver is affected by abnormal emotions, features of the vehiclesâ€™ trajectories will change unexpectedly, causing the active safety system to misestimate safety risks. In order to solve this problem, this research proposes a new trajectory prediction model: CPSOR-GCN, which predicts vehicle trajectories under abnormal emotions based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) cognitive theory. The model takes into account both the physical movement features and cognitive features of the driver. At the physical level, the interaction features between vehicles are learned by the physical GCN module. At the cognitive level, the dynamic Bayesian network (SOR-DBN) based on SOR theory reveals the influence mechanism of emotions on driving behavior. The cognitive GCN module extracts cognitive features. The CARLA-SUMO joint driving simulation platform was built to develop dangerous pre-crash scenarios. Methods of recreating traffic scenes were used to naturally induce abnormal emotions of anger and fright. The experiment collected simulation driving data from 26 participants to verify the prediction model we proposed. The results show that adding cognitive features improves trajectory prediction accuracy by 21.14%. Furthermore, the consideration of the SO-DBN cognitive framework further reduced the prediction error by 15.93%. Compared with other advanced trajectory prediction models, the prediction results of CPSOR-GCN also have lower errors. This model can be integrated into active safety systems to better adapt to the driver's emotion, which could effectively reduce the occurrence of false alarms.  </small> </p>
